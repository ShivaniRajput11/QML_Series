# QML_Series

# Series 1- VQC_Titanic-Data

## learn how to train a quantum machine learning model to tackle a classification problem by considering a real-life classical dataset.

## First, weâ€™ll load the dataset and explore what it looks like.

## Trained QML model

## Did dimensionality reduction using PCA and tried different encoding and ansatz to compare the VQC scores
